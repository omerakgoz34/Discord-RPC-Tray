# Discord-RPC-Tray

Most lightweight app to make custom Discord "playing" statuses :P (WIP)

## Installation
* **Windows:** Download from the [Releases](https://github.com/omerakgoz34/Discord-RPC-Tray/releases) page and run it. (I will add it to [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) extras repo in the future)
* **Linux:** *WIP...*
* **macOS:** *WIP...*

## Features
* Written in Go :P
* Terminal based UI for fast and lightweight usage
* Uses 0,0% CPU and 8MB of RAM on my windows PC
* Of course a Tray icon for working in the background!
* UPX compression for smaller file sizes

Maybe in the future I can add some extra features like displaying the CPU and RAM usage of the PC on Discord profile :D
